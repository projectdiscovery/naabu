Naabu is a port scanning tool written in Go that allows you to enumerate valid ports for hosts in a fast and reliable manner. It is a really simple tool that does fast SYN/CONNECT scans on the host/list of hosts and lists
all ports that return a reply.

# Installation Instructions

Download the ready to run [binary](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu/releases/) / [docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/projectdiscovery/naabu) or install with GO

Before installing naabu, make sure to install `libpcap` library with `apt install -y libpcap-dev` on Linux

```sh
GO111MODULE=on go get -v github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu/v2/cmd/naabu
```

# Running Naabu

To run the tool on a target, just use the following command.
```sh
naabu -host hackerone.com
```

This will run the tool against hackerone.com. There are a number of configuration options that you can pass along with this command. The verbose switch `-v` can be used to display verbose information.

```sh
naabu -host hackerone.com

                  __

[INF] Running SYN scan with root privileges
[INF] Found 4 ports on host hackerone.com (104.16.100.52)
hackerone.com:80
hackerone.com:443
hackerone.com:8443
hackerone.com:8080
```

The ports to scan for on the host can be specified via `-p` parameter. It takes nmap format ports and runs enumeration on them.

```sh
naabu -p 80,443,21-23 -host hackerone.com
```

By default, the Naabu checks for nmap's `Top 100` ports. It supports following in-built port lists -

- `-top-ports 100` => Scans for nmap top 100 port
- `-top-ports 1000` => Scans for nmap top 1000 port
- `-p -` => Scans for all ports from `1-65535`.

You can also specify specific ports which you would like to exclude from the scan.

```sh
naabu -p - -exclude-ports 80,443
```

The `o` flag can be used to specify an output file.

```sh
naabu -host hackerone.com -o output.txt
```

To run the naabu on a list of hosts, `-iL` option can be used.

```sh
naabu -iL hosts.txt
```

You can also get output in json format using `-json` switch. This switch saves the output in the JSON lines format.

```sh
naabu -host hackerone.com -json

{"host":"hackerone.com","ip":"104.16.99.52","port":8443}
{"host":"hackerone.com","ip":"104.16.99.52","port":80}
{"host":"hackerone.com","ip":"104.16.99.52","port":443}
{"host":"hackerone.com","ip":"104.16.99.52","port":8080}
```

The ports discovered can be piped to other tools too. For example, you can pipe the ports discovered by naabu to [httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx) which will then find running http servers on the host.

```sh
echo hackerone.com | naabu -silent | httpx -silent

http://hackerone.com:8443
http://hackerone.com:443
http://hackerone.com:8080
http://hackerone.com:80
```

If you want a second layer validation of the ports found, you can instruct the tool to make a TCP connection for every port and verify if the connection succeeded. This method is very slow, but is really reliable.  This is similar to using nmap as a second layer validation

```sh
naabu -host hackerone.com -verify
```

The speed can be controlled by changing the value of `rate` flag that represent the number of packets per second. Increasing it while processing hosts may lead to increased false-positive rates. So it is recommended to keep it to a reasonable amount.

# Configuration file

We have added support for config file, it allows each and every flag to define in config file, so you don't have to write them everytime, it's optional and not used on default run, default location of config file is `$HOME/.config/naabu/naabu.conf`, custom config file can be provided using `config` flag.

</details>

# Nmap integration

We have integrated nmap support with `nmap` flag, in config file you can define any `nmap` command you wish to run on the result of naabu, make sure you have `nmap` installed to use this feature.

To make use of `nmap` flag, make sure to remove the comments from the config file at `$HOME/.config/naabu/naabu.conf`

We also added `nmap-cli` flag that let you run **nmap** commands directly on the results of naabu without making use of config file.

```sh
echo hackerone.com | naabu -nmap-cli 'nmap -sV -oX naabu-output'

# CDN Exclusion

Naabu also supports excluding CDN IPs being port scanned. If used, only `80` and `443` ports get scanned for those IPs. This feature can be enabled by using `exclude-cdn` flag.

Currently `cloudflare`, `akamai`, `incapsula` and `sucuri` IPs are supported for exclusions.

# ðŸ“‹ Notes
- Naabu is designed to scan ports on multiple hosts / mass port scanning. 
- As default naabu is configured with a assumption that you are running it from VPS.
- We suggest to tune the flags / rate if running naabu from local system.
- For best results, run naabu as **root** user.

naabu is made with ðŸ–¤ by the [projectdiscovery](https://projectdiscovery.io) team. Community contributions have made the project what it is. See the **[Thanks.md](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu/blob/master/THANKS.md)** file for more details.
