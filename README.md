naabu is a port scanning tool written in Go that allows you to enumerate valid ports for hosts in a fast and reliable manner. It is a really simple tool that does fast SYN scans on the host/list of hosts and lists
all ports that return a reply. 

Inspired by the great `furious` project of [@liamg](https://github.com/liamg).

# Installation Instructions
## Direct Installation

### Linux

There are various ways to install the tool on linux. You can install it via docker, 
directly `go get` it or download and run the binary. 

#### From Source

naabu requires go1.13+ to install successfully. Run the following command to get the repo - 

```bash
go get -v github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu/cmd/naabu
```

#### From Binary

The installation is easy. You can download the pre-built binaries from the [Releases](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu/releases/) page. Extract them using tar, move it to your $PATH and you're ready to go.

```bash
> tar -xzvf naabu-linux-amd64.tar
> mv naabu-linux-amd64 /usr/bin/naabu
> naabu 
```

#### From Docker

You can use the official dockerhub image at [naabu](https://hub.docker.com/r/projectdiscovery/naabu). Simply run - 

```bash
> docker pull projectdiscovery/naabu
```

The above command will pull the latest tagged release from the dockerhub repository.

If you want to build the container yourself manually, git clone the repo, then build and run the following commands

- Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu.git`
- Build your docker container
```bash
docker build -t projectdiscovery/naabu .
```

- After building the container using either way, run the following - 
```bash
docker run -it projectdiscovery/naabu
```

> The above command is the same as running `-h`

For example, this runs the tool against hackerone.com and output the results to your host file system:
```bash
docker run -v -it projectdiscovery/naabu -d hackerone.com > hackerone.com.txt
```

### MacOS

`gopacket` has some issues on MacOS. Until that is fixed, Naabu can only run on MacOS with docker. See the [From Docker](#from-docker) section for install instructions on MacOS.

### Windows

Just like MacOS, you can only run naabu on windows with Docker. See the [From Docker](#from-docker) section for install instructions on Windows.

# Running Naabu

To run the tool on a target, just use the following command.
```bash
> naabu -d hackerone.com
```

This will run the tool against hackerone.com. There are a number of configuration options that you can pass along with this command. The verbose switch (-v) can be used to display verbose information.

```bash
[INF] Starting scan on host hackerone.com (104.16.100.52)
[INF] Found 4 ports on host hackerone.com (104.16.100.52) with latency 25.46362ms
hackerone.com:443
hackerone.com:8443
hackerone.com:80
hackerone.com:8080
```

The ports to scan for on the host can be specified via `-ports` parameter. It takes nmap format ports and runs enumeration on them.

```bash
> naabu -ports 80,443,21-23 -host hackerone.com
```

By default, the tool checks for nmap's `Top 100` ports. It supports following in-built port lists - 

- `top-100` - Checks for nmap top 100 ports.
- `top-1000` - Checks for nmap top 1000 ports.
- `full` - Checks for 1-65535 ports.

You can also specify a file which contains the ports to scan for using the `pL` format. You can also specify specific ports which you would like to exclude from the scan.

```bash
> naabu -ports full -exclude-ports 80,443
```

The -o command can be used to specify an output file.

```bash
> naabu -d hackerone.com -o output.txt
```

To run the tool on a list of hosts, `-hL` option can be used. This requires a directory to write the output files. Ports for each host from the list are written in a text file in the directory specified by the `-oD` flag with their name being the host name.

```bash
> cat hosts.txt
hackerone.com
google.com

> naabu -hL hosts.txt -oD ~/path/to/output
> ls ~/path/to/output

hackerone.com.txt
google.com.txt
```

If you want to save results to a single file while using a domain list, specify the -o flag with the name of the output file.


```bash
> cat hosts.txt
hackerone.com
google.com

> naabu -dL hosts.txt -o ~/path/to/output.txt
> ls ~/path/to/

output.txt
```

You can also get output in json format using -oJ switch. This switch saves the output in the JSON lines format. 

```bash
> naabu -host hackerone.com -oJ -o output.json
> cat output.json

{"host":"hackerone.com","ip":8443}
{"host":"hackerone.com","ip":443}
{"host":"hackerone.com","ip":8080}
{"host":"hackerone.com","ip":80}
```

The -silent switch can be used to show only ports found without any other info.

Hosts can also be piped to naabu and port enumeration can be ran on them. For example - 

```
> echo "hackerone.com" | naabu -v 
> cat targets.txt | naabu -v 
```

The ports discovered can be piped to other tools too. For example, you can pipe the ports discovered by naabu to the awesome [httprobe](https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe) tool by @tomnomnom which will then find running http servers on the host.

```
> echo "hackerone.com" | naabu -silent | httprobe

http://hackerone.com:8443
http://hackerone.com:443
http://hackerone.com:8080
http://hackerone.com:80
https://hackerone.com:443
```

If you want a second layer validation of the ports found, you can instruct the tool to make a TCP connection for every port and verify if the connection succeeded. This method is very slow, but is really reliable.

```bash
> naabu -h hackerone.com -verify
```

The most optimal setting for `threads` is 10. Increasing it while processing hosts may lead to increased false positive rates. So it is recommended to keep it low.

While scanning for a list of hosts, if duplicate IP addresses are encountered, it returns ports that were found for that IP.
