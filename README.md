Naabu is a port scanning tool written in Go that allows you to enumerate valid ports for hosts in a fast and reliable manner. It is a really simple tool that does fast SYN/CONNECT scans on the host/list of hosts and lists
all ports that return a reply.

# Installation Instructions

Download the ready to run [binary](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu/releases/) / [docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/projectdiscovery/naabu) or install with GO

Before installing naabu, make sure to install `libpcap` library:

```sh
sudo apt install -y libpcap-dev
```

Installing Naabu:

```sh
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu/v2/cmd/naabu@latest
```

# Running Naabu

To run the tool on a target, just use the following command.
```sh
naabu -host hackerone.com
```

This will run the tool against hackerone.com. There are a number of configuration options that you can pass along with this command. The verbose switch `-v` can be used to display verbose information.

```console
naabu -host hackerone.com

                  __

[INF] Running SYN scan with root privileges
[INF] Found 4 ports on host hackerone.com (104.16.100.52)
hackerone.com:80
hackerone.com:443
hackerone.com:8443
hackerone.com:8080
```

The ports to scan for on the host can be specified via `-p` parameter. It takes nmap format ports and runs enumeration on them.

```sh
naabu -p 80,443,21-23 -host hackerone.com
```

By default, the Naabu checks for nmap's `Top 100` ports. It supports following in-built port lists -

| CMD               | Description                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `-top-ports 100`  | Scan for nmap top **100** port       |
| `-top-ports 1000` | Scan for nmap top **1000** port      |
| `-p - `           | Scan for full ports from **1-65535** |

You can also specify specific ports which you would like to exclude from the scan.

```sh
naabu -p - -exclude-ports 80,443
```

The `o` flag can be used to specify an output file.

```sh
naabu -host hackerone.com -o output.txt
```

To run the naabu on a list of hosts, `-list` option can be used.

```sh
naabu -list hosts.txt
```

You can also get output in json format using `-json` switch. This switch saves the output in the JSON lines format.

```console
naabu -host hackerone.com -json

{"host":"hackerone.com","ip":"104.16.99.52","port":8443}
{"host":"hackerone.com","ip":"104.16.99.52","port":80}
{"host":"hackerone.com","ip":"104.16.99.52","port":443}
{"host":"hackerone.com","ip":"104.16.99.52","port":8080}
```

The ports discovered can be piped to other tools too. For example, you can pipe the ports discovered by naabu to [httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx) which will then find running http servers on the host.

```console
echo hackerone.com | naabu -silent | httpx -silent

http://hackerone.com:8443
http://hackerone.com:443
http://hackerone.com:8080
http://hackerone.com:80
```

The speed can be controlled by changing the value of `rate` flag that represent the number of packets per second. Increasing it while processing hosts may lead to increased false-positive rates. So it is recommended to keep it to a reasonable amount.

# Configuration file

Naabu supports config file as default located at `$HOME/.config/naabu/config.yaml`, It allows you to define any flag in the config file and set default values to include for all scans.


# Nmap integration

We have integrated nmap support for service discovery or any additional scans supported by nmap on the found results by Naabu, make sure you have `nmap` installed to use this feature.

To use,`nmap-cli` flag can be used followed by nmap command, for example:-

```console
echo hackerone.com | naabu -nmap-cli 'nmap -sV -oX nmap-output'
                  __

# CDN Exclusion

Naabu also supports excluding CDN IPs being port scanned. If used, only `80` and `443` ports get scanned for those IPs. This feature can be enabled by using `exclude-cdn` flag.

Currently `cloudflare`, `akamai`, `incapsula` and `sucuri` IPs are supported for exclusions.

# ðŸ“‹ Notes
- Naabu is designed to scan ports on multiple hosts / mass port scanning. 
- As default naabu is configured with a assumption that you are running it from VPS.
- We suggest to tune the flags / rate if running naabu from local system.
- For best results, run naabu as **root** user.

naabu is made with ðŸ–¤ by the [projectdiscovery](https://projectdiscovery.io) team. Community contributions have made the project what it is. See the **[Thanks.md](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu/blob/master/THANKS.md)** file for more details.
