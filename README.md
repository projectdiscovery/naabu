naabu is a port scanning tool written in Go that allows you to enumerate valid ports for hosts in a fast and reliable manner. 

It is a really simple tool that does fast SYN scans on the host/list of hosts and lists
all ports that return a reply.

# Installation Instructions
## Direct Installation

#### subfinder requires go1.13+ to install successfully !

The installation is easy. You can download the pre-built binaries for different platforms from the [Releases](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/releases/) page. Extract them using tar, move it to your $PATH and you're ready to go.

```bash
> tar -xzvf subfinder-linux-amd64.tar
> mv subfinder-linux-amd64 /usr/bin/subfinder
> subfinder 
```

If you want to build it yourself, you can go get the repo

```bash
go get -v github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/cmd/subfinder
```

## Upgrading
If you wish to upgrade the package you can use:
```bash
go get -u -v github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/cmd/subfinder
```
## Running in a Docker Container

You can use the official dockerhub image at [subfinder](https://hub.docker.com/r/ice3man/subfinder). Simply run - 

```bash
> docker pull ice3man/subfinder
```

The above command will pull the latest tagged release from the dockerhub repository.

If you want to build the container yourself manually, git clone the repo, then build and run the following commands

- Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder.git`
- Build your docker container
```bash
docker build -t ice3man/subfinder .
```

- After building the container using either way, run the following - 
```bash
docker run -it ice3man/subfinder
```
> The above command is the same as running `-h`

For example, this runs the tool against uber.com and output the results to your host file system:
```bash
docker run -v $HOME/.config/subfinder:/root/.config/subfinder -it ice3man/subfinder -d uber.com > uber.com.txt
```

## Post Installation Instructions

Subfinder will work after using the installation instructions however to configure Subfinder to work with certain services, you will need to have setup API keys. The following services do not work without an API key:

- [Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)
- [Passivetotal](http://passivetotal.org/)
- [SecurityTrails](http://securitytrails.com/)
- [Censys](https://censys.io)
- [Binaryedge](https://binaryedge.io)
- [Shodan](https://shodan.io)
- [URLScan](https://urlscan.io)

Theses values are stored in the $HOME/.config/subfinder/config.yaml file which will be created when you run the tool for the first time. The configuration file uses the YAML format. Multiple API keys can be specified for each of these services from which one of them will be used for enumeration.

For sources that require multiple keys, namely `Censys`, `Passivetotal`, they can be added by separating them via a colon (:).

An example config file - 

```yaml
resolvers:
  - 1.1.1.1
  - 1.0.0.1
sources:
  - binaryedge
  - bufferover
  - censys
  - passivetotal
  - sitedossier
binaryedge:
  - 0bf8919b-aab9-42e4-9574-d3b639324597
  - ac244e2f-b635-4581-878a-33f4e79a2c13
censys:
  - ac244e2f-b635-4581-878a-33f4e79a2c13:dd510d6e-1b6e-4655-83f6-f347b363def9
certspotter: []
passivetotal: 
  - sampleemail@user.com:sample_password
securitytrails: []
shodan: []
```

If you are using docker, you need to first create your directory structure holding subfinder configuration file. After modifying the default config.yaml file, you can run:

```bash
> mkdir $HOME/.config/subfinder
> cp config.yaml $HOME/.config/subfinder/config.yaml
> nano $HOME/.config/subfinder/config.yaml
```

After that, you can pass it as a volume using the following sample command.
```bash
> docker run -v $HOME/.config/subfinder:/root/.config/subfinder -it ice3man/subfinder -d freelancer.com
```

# Running Subfinder

To run the tool on a target, just use the following command.
```bash
> subfinder -d freelancer.com
```

This will run the tool against freelancer.com. There are a number of configuration options that you can pass along with this command. The verbose switch (-v) can be used to display verbose information.

```bash
[CERTSPOTTER] www.fi.freelancer.com
[DNSDUMPSTER] hosting.freelancer.com
[DNSDUMPSTER] support.freelancer.com
[DNSDUMPSTER] accounts.freelancer.com
[DNSDUMPSTER] phabricator.freelancer.com
[DNSDUMPSTER] cdn1.freelancer.com
[DNSDUMPSTER] t1.freelancer.com
[DNSDUMPSTER] wdc.t1.freelancer.com
[DNSDUMPSTER] dal.t1.freelancer.com
```

The -o command can be used to specify an output file.

```bash
> subfinder -d freelancer.com -o output.txt
```

To run the tool on a list of domains, `-dL` option can be used. This requires a directory to write the output files. Subdomains for each domain from the list are written in a text file in the directory specified by the `-oD` flag with their name being the domain name.

```bash
> cat domains.txt
hackerone.com
google.com

> subfinder -dL domains.txt -oD ~/path/to/output
> ls ~/path/to/output

hackerone.com.txt
google.com.txt
```

If you want to save results to a single file while using a domain list, specify the -o flag with the name of the output file.


```bash
> cat domains.txt
hackerone.com
google.com

> subfinder -dL domains.txt -o ~/path/to/output.txt
> ls ~/path/to/

output.txt
```

You can also get output in json format using -oJ switch. This switch saves the output in the JSON lines format. 

If you use the JSON format, or the Host:IP format, then it becomes mandatory for you to use the **-nW** format as resolving is essential for these output format. By default, resolving the found subdomains is disabled.

```bash
> subfinder -d hackerone.com -o output.json -oJ -nW
> cat output.json

{"host":"www.hackerone.com","ip":"104.16.99.52"}
{"host":"mta-sts.hackerone.com","ip":"185.199.108.153"}
{"host":"hackerone.com","ip":"104.16.100.52"}
{"host":"mta-sts.managed.hackerone.com","ip":"185.199.110.153"}
```

The --silent switch can be used to show only subdomains found without any other info.

You can specify custom resolvers too.
```bash
> subfinder -d freelancer.com -o result.txt -nW -v -r 8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1
> subfinder -d freelancer.com -o result.txt -nW -v -rL resolvers.txt
```

**The new highlight of this release is the addition of stdin/stdout features.** Now, domains can be piped to subfinder and enumeration can be ran on them. For example - 

```
> echo "hackerone.com" | subfinder -v 
> cat targets.txt | subfinder -v 
```

The subdomains discovered can be piped to other tools too. For example, you can pipe the subdomains discovered by subfinder to the awesome [httprobe](https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe) tool by @tomnomnom which will then find running http servers on the host.

```
> echo "hackerone.com" | subfinder -silent | httprobe 

http://hackerone.com
